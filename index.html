            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I received my first computer back in 1996. At the time I was just a kid who knew that with this box, I
                could unlock a whole new world of gaming. I was obsessed. Whether it be doing extra chores and working
                to afford peripheals or asking for specific computer parts as birthday presents, I was hooked. Along
                with that passion for pc gaming, I started delving into the world wide web, and it wouldn't be too long
                before I was enamored by the wealth of information right at my very fingertips. I was well ahead of
                those around me in terms of knowing how to use computers, and I had a hint that it would someday be the
                very thing that I did for a living. </p>

            <p>
                Fast forward many years, and while I don't work in the computer industry, they are very much involved in
                my everyday life. About 10 years ago, I went to get my associates degree and took a few computer courses
                along the way. While I got the associates degree, life got real busy, and I never managed to finish what
                I
                thought was going to turn into me getting a bachelors degree in computer science and turning my hobby
                into
                my career. That's all about to change.

            </p>
            <p>
                I've always jokingly said things like, "someday I'm gonna make a program that does that,"" or "wouldn't
                all this be easier if there was an app that would do that?" Now I'm fully invested into a coding
                bootcamp
                where I hope to pick up the tools and knowledge in order to become a succesful software developer. I've
                only
                just started but this page will help you see my progress and see if I am the right fit for you.
