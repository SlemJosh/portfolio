            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I received my first computer back in 1996. At the time I was just a kid who knew that with this box, I
                could unlock a whole new world of gaming. I was obsessed. Whether it be doing extra chores and working
                to afford peripheals or asking for specific computer parts as birthday presents, I was hooked. Along
                with that passion for pc gaming, I started delving into the world wide web, and it wouldn't be too long
                before I was enamored by the wealth of information right at my very fingertips. I was well ahead of
                those around me in terms of knowing how to use computers, and I had a hint that it would someday be the
                very thing that I did for a living. </p>

            <p>Fast forward many years, and while I don't work in the computer industry,
                I use them more and more everday for my hobbies and own enjoyment. That is all about to change.
                I took some computer courses years ago, but life got busy, and I fell away. Now, there's no stopping me.
                I've always jokingly said things like, "someday I'm gonna make a program that does that,"" or "wouldn't
                all this be easier if there was an app that would do that?" With this knowledge I'm receiving now, I
                will soon turn that into a reality. I hope to become a succesful software developer, and to perhaps pass
                on that passion to other kids who find joy in the computer world.
            </p>
