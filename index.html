                <p>
                    What started as a passion for gaming has encompassed my whole outlook on Tech and Computers. I'm
                    currently enrolled in a Full Stack Coding bootcamp adding to my various skills that I've picked up
                    since those early days of computing. Even though I haven't worked directly in a computer science
                    field
                    I've been using them for hobbies for the longest time. Because of that, I'm the go to guy in my
                    circle
                    of friends and family when it comes to tech. Not only can I service and repair most issues with
                    computers,
                    cell phones, and tvs, but I can also work with the interface on all of them to help the user obtain
                    a more
                    more valuable experience.

                    I'm a fast learner, and I work well both with teams and alone. You tell me the task at hand, and I
                    will get it done.
