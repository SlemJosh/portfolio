                    It started as a passion for gaming. Ever since my first computer in 1996, I wanted to be on it all
                    the
                    time gaming. As I grew more familiar with the internet and all it had to offer, it only begged
                    for more attention from me. Whilst in highschool even looked at procuring some of the skills to turn
                    this box of joy into a box of productivity. Stumbled along the way and again in college looked
                    at getting more of those skills to pay the bills. Life once again interrupted, but not before I had
                    a
                    chance to really sample some of the basics of what makes up a computer science degree. Now I'm fully
                    invested in a coding bootcamp, where I can focus on the work itself and finally fulfill my goal of
                    becoming a software developer/engineer in the near future.
