## Description

This project was all about making from scratch a porfolio website.  Not only did I need to code from scratch the html, but also the css file.  It took me a long time!
Whilst doing it though, and redoing it, and redoing it, I felt like I kept getting a better idea of how to do things.  My initial design was pretty bare bones.  The 
thing that caught me up was I wasn't very organized.  I found that I would be typing something on the HTML and then switching over to the CSS to style the thing I just typed. 
This had me going back and forth, and eventually I was even changing css stuff for previous things or future things, and I ended up getting a page that wouldn't load right.  
I spent the better part of a day going through it seeing if I could debug and troubleshoot the existing items and get them to peform to no avail.  At a cetain point, I just 
decided to start from scratch.  I had the basics, like the images I wanted, and even my wireframe and text all saved up.  So it was just time to tear down the house and rebuild.

On my best and last attempt, I started out slowly.  First, it was to build the HTML.  I wanted as much information and styling on the page as I could just from that respect.  It
was also super helpful to make sure that the page was divided and labeled.  As soon as I had that complete it was just a matter of going section by section on the css.  As I did this
was able to see my page take shape slowly, but correctly.  If something didn't work properly, I knew it was probably just a mistake I made recently, so I could go back and debug.  
Another helpful thing was that I was constantly pushing my work to github.  That way, if for some reason catastrophe struck, I could just pull it down from the last known version I 
pushed up, knowing that it was a working version.

Once both the CSS and HTML were complete, it was time to just test and test and test.  Because this project had a lot to do with flexboxes and changing the way the page looks based
on your screensize or platform you were doing, it took me a good deal of time to go through each issue. Similiar to how I was building it, I just tested it section by section.  
If my works section wasn't working, I'd comment it all out, and make sure the stuff below and above it were working, so that I could at least illiminate some of those worries.

I'd say I started this project about 4 days ago.  Day 1 and 2 were very stresfful because I felt like I was just hammering away at problem that was just not going to get fixed.
The moment late on day 2, where I decided lets just start over, there was a huge load lifted off my back.  All of a sudden I felt eager, and excited to get back in and design it from 
the very first line. Because I knew of the stress I dealt with the first couple days, I made sure that my new attempt was going to be one where I followed some simple guidelines I made 
for myself.  And as long as I stuck to that, everything was going smoothly.   

I will say again, that I debugged and debugged, and debugged.  And whilst the constant debugging seemed like maybe I hadn't done something right to begin with, it also helped me
gain additional insight and knowledge so that the next time I do it, I'll probably get it right, right away.  But even if I don't.  Each time I was solving one specific problem. It just 
made me feel terrific about the whole thing.  This project has really helped me decide that coding is more than likely a good fit for me.  Please to enjoy the page yourself.
