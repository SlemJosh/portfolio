/*First, we want to establish some basics.  I want the font to be simliar across all the text on the screen, so I first gave it a variable, and then applyy it in the body so that I don't have to redo it each time.  Added a shadow to that text.
Put the min height to 100vh, where vh is the viewport height, aka I want it to take up the whole page. */
